## I. Description of the Selected Topic

We selected the topic **Canteen Meal Budget Tracker** because it is simple, practical, and something that affects students every day.
This project is a digital system that allows students to **record and monitor how much they spend in the school canteen**. They can track their expenses for breakfast, lunch, dinner, and snacks, and see how much allowance they have left for the day or week.

We believe this system is important because it helps students, especially dormers, **stay aware of their spending** and make better decisions about their meals. It is a project that is realistic and achievable within the time frame we have.



## II. Problem Addressed

We noticed that many students often **overspend in the canteen** because they do not keep a record of their expenses. Sometimes, students run out of allowance before the week ends without realizing it.

We want to address this problem by creating a tool that allows students to **easily track their spending**, so they can see how much they have spent and how much money they still have. By solving this problem, students will be able to **budget better and avoid running out of money unexpectedly**.



## III. Why the Problem Is Worth Solving

We think this problem is worth solving because students rely on a **limited allowance**, and overspending can cause stress or difficulty during the week. Dormers are particularly affected because they rely entirely on the canteen for their meals.

By creating a simple system that tracks expenses, we can **help students plan their spending, avoid overspending, and develop better money management habits**. This project is not only useful but also teaches responsibility in a practical way.



## IV. Users and Their Needs

**Primary Users:**

* Students who buy meals regularly in the canteen
* Dormers who depend on the canteen for all meals

**Users’ Needs:**

* We want to provide a **quick and simple way** to record meal prices.
* Users should be able to **see total spending and remaining allowance** at any time.
* Students need a **summary of past expenses** to check how they managed their money.
* We want the system to be **easy to use** and not take too much time.



## V. Key Features

* **Meal Input:** Users can enter the price of each meal (breakfast, lunch, dinner, or snacks).
* **Daily Spending Calculation:** The system will automatically calculate the total spending for the day.
* **Remaining Allowance Display:** After each entry, users can see how much money is left.
* **Weekly Summary:** The system will show total spending for the week.
* **Expense History:** A simple log will allow students to review previous entries.

We chose these features because they are **easy to implement and very helpful** for students to monitor their allowance.



## VI. Expected Inputs and Outputs

**Inputs:**

* Money spent for each meal
* Daily or weekly allowance set by the student
* Date of each expense

**Outputs:**

* Total spent for the day
* Total spent for the week
* Remaining allowance after each entry
* A summary list of past expenses

We expect that the outputs will be **clear and easy to read**, helping students see their spending at a glance.


## VII. Final Reflection

**What we are most confident about:**
We are confident that this project is **practical, easy to understand, and directly useful** for students. The idea is based on real experiences, so it is **relatable**. We also feel confident that we can **build a working prototype** within the time given.

**What we would still like to improve:**
We would like to improve the **layout and organization** of the outputs to make them clearer. In the future, we hope to add features such as **reminders when spending reaches a limit** or a **color-coded warning** for students who are close to overspending. We also want to improve the weekly summary to help students **plan ahead more effectively**.
