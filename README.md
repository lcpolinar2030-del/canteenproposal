I. PROJECT OVERVIEW

The Canteen Meal Budget & Queue Tracker is a digital system designed to help students manage their meal allowance and avoid long lines in the school canteen.
It contains two central features:

    • A budget tracker that records meal expenses
    • A queue status indicator showing whether the canteen line is short, normal, or long

This project is practical and relatable for students, especially dormers, and fits the given project timeline.

II. BACKGROUND AND RATIONALE

Students commonly face two issues in their everyday school routine:

    1. Overspending their daily or weekly allowance
    2. Spending too much time waiting in long canteen lines

Dormers are particularly affected because they rely entirely on the canteen for their meals.
By combining financial tracking with a simple line-monitoring feature, this system helps students make informed decisions about when to eat and how to budget their money properly.

III. PROBLEM STATEMENT

Students currently lack a tool that allows them to:

    • Track meal expenses
    • View remaining allowance
    • Identify the best time to buy food
    • Avoid long canteen lines

Because of this, many students overspend or lose valuable break time waiting in line.

IV. TARGET USERS

    • Dormers
    • Regular students
    • Canteen staff
    • School administrators

V. PROJECT OBJECTIVES

The project aims to:

    1. Develop a system that tracks daily and weekly meal expenses
    2. Allow users to input their allowance
    3. Display updated remaining balance
    4. Provide a queue status indicator
    5. Produce a functional prototype for presentation
    6. Upload final documentation and files to GitHub

VI. SCOPE AND LIMITATIONS
Scope

The system includes:

    • Budget input
    • Meal expense tracker
    • Remaining balance calculation
    • Queue status indicator
    • Expense history log

Limitations

    • Queue status is manually updated
    • Applicable only to the school canteen
    • Prototype-level functionality
    • Not a full mobile application yet

VII. PROJECT FEATURES
1. Budget Input

Allows users to set their daily or weekly meal budget.

2. Expense Recorder

Students can record the cost of meals such as breakfast, lunch, dinner, and snacks.

3. Remaining Balance Display

Shows the updated allowance after each expense.

4. Queue Status Indicator

Displays line condition as:

    • Short
    • Normal
    • Long

5. Expense History Log

Shows previously recorded expenses for tracking and review.

VIII. EXPECTED INPUTS AND OUTPUTS
Expected Inputs

    • Daily or weekly budget
    • Meal expense value
    • Queue status selection
    • Date and time of entry

Expected Outputs

    • Updated remaining balance
    • List of expense entries
    • Queue status display
    • Summary of expenses per day or week
    • Full expense history

IX. METHODOLOGY

    1. Finalize project idea
    2. Research and gather sample systems
    3. Organize features and prepare initial draft
    4. Create GitHub repository
    5. Develop working prototype
    6. Test and revise features
    7. Finalize documentation
    8. Prepare presentation video

X. TOOLS AND TECHNOLOGIES

    • GitHub
    • HTML/CSS, Python, or Scratch (depending on teacher requirements)
    • Google Docs / Google Slides / Canva
    • Google Sheets (optional prototype development)

XI. EXPECTED OUTPUTS

    • A functioning prototype
    • Complete GitHub repository including:
        – Proposal
        – Documentation
        – Mockups
        – Source code (if required)
    • A three- to five-minute presentation

XII. BENEFITS OF THE PROJECT

    • Helps students manage allowance
    • Reduces unnecessary spending
    • Minimizes time wasted in long canteen queues
    • Helps dormers plan meals efficiently
    • Encourages responsible budgeting habits

XIII. FINAL REFLECTION ENTRY

What are you most confident about your draft?
We are confident that the proposal clearly explains the problem and presents a practical solution. The system is simple, achievable, and directly connected to real student life, which makes the idea strong and realistic.

What would you like to improve?
We want to improve the visual design of the prototype and make the interface cleaner. In the future, we hope to add more features such as an automated queue system or detailed spending analytics. We would also like to strengthen the presentation by adding clearer examples and better visuals.
