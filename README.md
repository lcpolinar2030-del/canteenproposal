## 📌 Project Description

The **Canteen Meal Budget Tracker** is a digital tool that helps students record and monitor how much they spend in the school canteen. Users can enter meal expenses, view daily and weekly totals, and see how much allowance they have left. This helps students manage their money better and avoid overspending.

## 🎯 Problem Addressed

Many students overspend because they don’t keep track of what they spend in the canteen. This tool solves that by letting students enter meal expenses and instantly see their spending and remaining allowance. :contentReference[oaicite:1]{index=1}

## 🧠 Why This Is Worth Solving

Students often run out of money before the week ends. By giving them a simple budgeting tool, we help them develop **money management skills** and avoid stress from unexpected overspending. :contentReference[oaicite:2]{index=2}
