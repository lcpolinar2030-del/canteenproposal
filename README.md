I. PROJECT OVERVIEW

The Canteen Meal Budget & Queue Tracker is a simple digital system created to help students manage their meal allowances and avoid long lines in the school canteen. The project includes two major features:

A budget tracker that records and calculates student meal expenses

A queue status indicator showing whether the canteen line is short, normal, or long

This project is highly relatable, realistic, and useful for both dormers and regular students. It is also achievable within the required project timeline.

II. BACKGROUND AND RATIONALE

Students commonly experience two everyday problems:

Overspending their daily or weekly meal allowance

Long lines in the school canteen that waste time

Dormers are especially affected because they rely heavily on the canteen for their meals. By combining a budget management tool with a queue tracking feature, students can save money, plan better, and avoid unnecessary waiting during break time.

III. PROBLEM STATEMENT

Students currently lack a simple system that helps them:

Track their meal expenses

See how much allowance they still have

Know the best time to buy food without falling into long lines

Plan their daily meals wisely

Because of this, many students overspend and waste valuable time waiting in queues.

IV. TARGET USERS

Dormers – need strict budgeting and meal planning

Regular students – want to avoid long lunch lines

Canteen staff – can use line data to improve serving flow

School administrators – can view usage trends for possible improvements

V. PROJECT OBJECTIVES

The project aims to:

Develop a meal budget tracking system

Allow students to input daily or weekly allowance

Display the remaining balance automatically

Provide a queue status indicator (short, normal, long)

Produce a functional prototype

Upload complete documentation and files to GitHub

VI. SCOPE AND LIMITATIONS
Scope:

The system will include:

Budget input

Meal expense tracking

Remaining balance calculation

Queue status indicator

Expense history display

Limitations:

Queue status will be manually updated, not automated

A 3–5 minute recorded or live presentation

XII. BENEFITS OF THE PROJECT

Helps students save money

Prevents overspending

Reduces wasted time in canteen lines

Helps dormers plan meals better

Promotes responsible budgeting habits

Improves daily convenience for students

XIII. FINAL REFLECTION ENTRY

What are you most confident about your draft?
We are confident that our project idea is practical, relatable, and clearly explained. The proposal shows a real problem that students face and provides a simple, helpful solution. Our features are achievable and easy to demonstrate in a presentation.

What would we like to improve?
We would like to improve the look of the system by designing a cleaner and more modern interface. In the future, we hope to make the queue tracker fully automated and add more features such as reminders or weekly spending graphs. We also want to enhance the presentation to make it more engaging and professional.
