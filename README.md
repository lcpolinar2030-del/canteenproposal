I. PROJECT OVERVIEW

The Canteen Meal Budget & Queue Tracker is a simple digital tool designed to help students manage their daily food allowance and avoid long canteen lines. The system combines two useful features: a budget tracker, which helps students record and monitor their meal expenses, and a queue tracker, which shows whether the canteen line is short, normal, or long.

This project is simple enough for student developers but meaningful because it directly addresses everyday problems students face, especially dormers who rely on the school canteen for all meals.

II. BACKGROUND AND RATIONALE

Students often struggle with two things:

Overspending on meals due to lack of tracking.

Long lines in the canteen, causing delays, stress, and wasted break time.

Dormers are affected the most because they eat in the canteen daily and must manage their weekly allowance carefully. A system that shows how much they’ve spent and how long the line is can help students make better decisions about eating times and budgeting.

Many existing apps online track expenses, and some systems monitor queues, but combining both into one student-friendly tool makes this project unique and practical.

III. PROBLEM STATEMENT

Students need a convenient way to:

Track how much they spend on meals

Know their remaining daily or weekly budget

Avoid long canteen lines

Plan their meals more efficiently

Without a tool, students end up overspending or wasting time in long queues.

IV. TARGET USERS

Dormers – need strict budget monitoring

Regular students – want to avoid long lines during lunch

Canteen staff – can use queue data to adjust operations

Teachers/admins – can see patterns in student meal schedules

V. PROJECT OBJECTIVES

By the end of this project, the group aims to:

Build a simple budget tracker for canteen meals.

Allow users to input their daily or weekly allowance.

Record expenses and display the remaining balance.

Provide a quick and simple queue status indicator.

Create a functional prototype for presentation.

Upload the complete project documentation to GitHub.

VI. SCOPE AND LIMITATIONS
Scope

The system will include:

Budget input

Expense recording

Real-time balance display

Queue status (short, normal, long)

Simple interface for students

Limitations

Queue tracking is manual, updated by a student or canteen staff

System is not fully automated with sensors

Only for the school canteen (not external restaurants)

Prototype level, not a full mobile app yet

VII. PROJECT FEATURES
1. Daily/Weekly Budget Input

Users can enter their allowance amount.

2. Meal Expense Tracker

Records spending for breakfast, lunch, dinner, or snacks.

3. Remaining Balance Display

Automatically updates budget after every input.

4. Queue Tracker

Shows the status of the canteen line:

Green: Short

Yellow: Normal

Red: Long

5. Expense History Log

A list of past expenses for review.

VIII. INPUTS AND OUTPUTS
Inputs:

Budget amount

Cost of each meal

Queue status (manual selection)

Outputs:

Remaining balance

Summary of expenses

Queue indicator

History log

IX. METHODOLOGY
